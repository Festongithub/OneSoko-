# üîí Shop Security and Access Control Implementation

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive security measures implemented to ensure that **only shop owners can access their own shops** and related resources in the OneSoko platform.

## üéØ Security Objectives

1. **Shop Ownership Validation**: Only shop owners can manage their own shops
2. **Resource Isolation**: Shop owners cannot access other shop owners' resources
3. **Authentication Enforcement**: All shop management operations require authentication
4. **Permission Granularity**: Different permission levels for different operations
5. **Security Logging**: Monitor and log access attempts for security analysis

## üõ°Ô∏è Security Implementation

### 1. Enhanced Permission Classes

#### `IsShopOwner`
```python
# Location: permissions.py
class IsShopOwner(permissions.BasePermission):
    """
    Ensures only authenticated users with shop owner status can access resources.
    Includes object-level permissions to validate shop ownership.
    """
```

**Features:**
- ‚úÖ Validates user authentication
- ‚úÖ Checks `is_shopowner` flag in user profile
- ‚úÖ Object-level ownership validation
- ‚úÖ Security logging for unauthorized access attempts

#### `IsShopOwnerForManagement`
```python
# Location: permissions.py
class IsShopOwnerForManagement(permissions.BasePermission):
    """
    Strict permission for shop management operations.
    No read-only access for non-owners.
    """
```

**Features:**
- ‚úÖ Stricter than `IsShopOwner`
- ‚úÖ No fallback to read-only access
- ‚úÖ Comprehensive ownership validation
- ‚úÖ Enhanced security logging

### 2. ViewSet Security Enhancements

#### ShopViewSet Dynamic Permissions
```python
def get_permissions(self):
    """Dynamic permissions based on action type"""
    if self.action == 'create':
        permission_classes = [IsShopOwner]
    elif self.action in ['update', 'partial_update', 'destroy']:
        permission_classes = [IsShopOwner]
    elif self.action in ['my_shops', 'add_product', 'delete_product', 'products']:
        permission_classes = [IsShopOwnerForManagement]
    elif self.action in ['public_list', 'public_detail', 'search']:
        permission_classes = [permissions.AllowAny]
    else:
        permission_classes = [IsShopOwner]
```

#### Filtered QuerySets
```python
def get_queryset(self):
    """Filter queryset based on user permissions and action"""
    if self.action in ['list', 'retrieve', 'update', 'partial_update', 'destroy']:
        # Management operations: only user's own shops
        return Shop.objects.filter(shopowner=self.request.user)
    elif self.action == 'my_shops':
        # Explicitly for user's own shops
        return Shop.objects.filter(shopowner=self.request.user)
    else:
        # Public endpoints: all active shops
        return Shop.objects.all()
```

### 3. API Endpoint Security

#### Public Endpoints (No Authentication Required)
- `GET /api/shops/public_list/` - Browse all active shops
- `GET /api/shops/public_detail/{shop_id}/` - View shop details
- `GET /api/shops/search/` - Search shops
- `GET /api/shops/by_category/` - Filter shops by category
- `GET /api/shops/nearby/` - Find nearby shops

#### Shop Owner Only Endpoints (Authentication + Shop Owner Status Required)
- `POST /api/shops/` - Create shop
- `GET /api/shops/my_shops/` - Get user's shops
- `PUT/PATCH /api/shops/{shop_id}/` - Update own shop
- `DELETE /api/shops/{shop_id}/` - Delete own shop

#### Shop Management Endpoints (Ownership Validation Required)
- `GET /api/shops/{shop_id}/products/` - View shop products
- `POST /api/shops/{shop_id}/add_product/` - Add product to shop
- `DELETE /api/shops/{shop_id}/products/{product_id}/` - Remove product from shop

### 4. Security Middleware

#### `ShopAccessSecurityMiddleware`
```python
# Location: shop_security.py
class ShopAccessSecurityMiddleware(MiddlewareMixin):
    """Additional security validation for shop operations"""
```

**Features:**
- ‚úÖ Pre-request validation for shop operations
- ‚úÖ Authentication enforcement
- ‚úÖ Shop owner status validation
- ‚úÖ Access pattern logging
- ‚úÖ Failed attempt monitoring

### 5. Access Control Decorators

#### `@shop_owner_required`
```python
# Location: shop_access_control.py
@shop_owner_required
def my_view(request):
    # Only shop owners can access this view
```

#### `@shop_ownership_required`
```python
@shop_ownership_required('shop_id')
def shop_specific_view(request, shop_id):
    # Only the shop owner can access their specific shop
```

#### `@secure_shop_operation`
```python
@secure_shop_operation("product_management")
def manage_products(request):
    # Comprehensive security for shop operations
```

## üîç Security Validation Flow

### 1. Request Processing
```
1. Request arrives at endpoint
2. Middleware validates shop-related operations
3. Authentication check
4. Shop owner status validation
5. Object-level ownership check
6. Action execution or access denial
7. Security logging
```

### 2. Permission Validation
```python
# Step 1: User Authentication
if not request.user.is_authenticated:
    return 401 Unauthorized

# Step 2: Shop Owner Status
if not request.user.profile.is_shopowner:
    return 403 Forbidden

# Step 3: Object Ownership
if shop.shopowner != request.user:
    return 403 Forbidden

# Step 4: Action Allowed
return 200 OK
```

## üìä Security Monitoring

### 1. Access Logging
- ‚úÖ Successful shop operations logged
- ‚úÖ Failed access attempts logged
- ‚úÖ Unauthorized access attempts tracked
- ‚úÖ Security patterns analyzed

### 2. Cache-based Monitoring
```python
# Recent access patterns stored in cache
cache_key = f"shop_access_{user_id}_{method}_{path}"
cache.set(cache_key, access_data, timeout=300)
```

### 3. Security Alerts
- Unauthorized access attempts to shops
- Multiple failed access attempts
- Suspicious access patterns
- Profile-related security issues

    'ENABLE_ACCESS_LOGGING': True,
    'LOG_FAILED_ATTEMPTS': True,
    'CACHE_ACCESS_PATTERNS': True,

    },
}
```

## üß™ Testing Shop Security

### 1. Authentication Tests
```python
# Test unauthenticated access
response = client.get('/api/shops/my_shops/')
assert response.status_code == 401

# Test non-shop-owner access
response = customer_client.get('/api/shops/my_shops/')
assert response.status_code == 403
```

### 2. Ownership Tests
```python
# Test accessing another shop owner's shop
response = shop_owner1_client.put(f'/api/shops/{shop_owner2_shop_id}/')
assert response.status_code == 403

# Test accessing own shop
response = shop_owner1_client.put(f'/api/shops/{shop_owner1_shop_id}/')
assert response.status_code == 200
```

### 3. Security Bypass Tests
```python
# Test direct object access bypass attempts
# Test parameter manipulation
# Test permission escalation attempts
```
