# Enhanced Two-Tier Authentication System Implementation

## 🎯 **Overview**

We've successfully implemented a sophisticated two-tier authentication system for OneSoko that provides different user experiences for shop owners and regular customers, similar to business accounts on platforms like Twitter/X.

## ✅ **Key Features Implemented**

### 1. **Enhanced Authentication Context**
- **Shop-aware authentication** with automatic shop loading
- **Active shop management** with localStorage persistence
- **Personalized welcome messages** based on user type and shop count
- **Smart redirect logic** for different user types

### 2. **Shop Owner Experience**
- **Automatic redirect** to shop dashboard after login
- **Multi-shop support** with shop selector in navbar
- **Shop-specific welcome messages**: "Hello [Name], welcome to your [Shop Name] shop! 🏪"
- **Account-like shop switching** similar to Twitter/X business accounts

### 3. **Smart Navigation**
- **ShopSelector component** in navbar for easy shop switching
- **Active shop persistence** across sessions
- **Context-aware routing** based on user type
- **SmartRedirect component** for intelligent home page routing

## 🔧 **Technical Implementation**

### **Enhanced AuthContext** (`src/contexts/AuthContext.tsx`)

**New Properties:**
```typescript
interface AuthContextType {
  // ... existing properties
  userShops: Shop[];           // All shops owned by user
  activeShop: Shop | null;     // Currently selected shop
  setActiveShop: (shop: Shop | null) => void;
  isShopOwner: boolean;        // Helper for shop owner status
}
```

**Smart Welcome Messages:**
- **Single shop owner**: "Hello [Name], welcome to your [Shop Name] shop! 🏪"
- **Multi-shop owner**: "Hello [Name], welcome back! You're managing [X] shops. Currently active: [Shop Name] 🏪"
- **Shop owner without shops**: "Hello [Name], welcome to OneSoko! Ready to create your first shop? 🚀"
- **Regular user**: "Dear [Name], welcome to OneSoko! 🛍️"

### **Shop Selector Component** (`src/components/shops/ShopSelector.tsx`)

**Features:**
- Dropdown with all user shops
- Visual shop avatars with initials
- Current shop indication with checkmark
- "Create New Shop" option
- Location display for each shop
- Responsive design with dark mode support

### **Enhanced Login Flow** (`src/pages/Login.tsx`)

**Smart Redirect Logic:**
```typescript
if (profile.is_shopowner) {
  if (userShops.length > 0) {
    // Redirect to shop dashboard or intended shop page
    if (from.startsWith('/shop') && from !== '/shop-dashboard') {
      navigate(from, { replace: true });
    } else {
      navigate('/shop-dashboard', { replace: true });
    }
  } else {
    // No shops - redirect to create shop
    navigate('/create-shop', { replace: true });
  }
} else {
  // Regular user - go to intended page
  navigate(from, { replace: true });
}
```

### **Smart Redirect Component** (`src/components/SmartRedirect.tsx`)

**Auto-redirect Logic:**
- Shop owners with shops → Shop dashboard
- Regular users → Stay on landing page
- Unauthenticated users → Stay on landing page

### **Updated Navbar** (`src/components/layout/Navbar.tsx`)

**Shop Owner Enhancements:**
- Shop selector prominently displayed
- Context-aware navigation
- Shop-specific branding

## 🚀 **User Journey Examples**

3. **Welcome message** shows: "Hello John, welcome to your Electronics Store shop! 🏪"
4. **Automatically redirected** to `/shop-dashboard`
5. **Shop selector** appears in navbar for easy switching
6. **Active shop** persisted in localStorage for next session

### **Multi-Shop Owner Experience:**

1. **Login** shows: "Hello Sarah, welcome back! You're managing 3 shops. Currently active: Fashion Boutique 🏪"
2. **Shop selector** shows all 3 shops with switching capability
3. **Create new shop** option available in dropdown
4. **Context switches** automatically when different shop selected

### **Regular User Experience:**

1. **Login** shows: "Dear Mike, welcome to OneSoko! 🛍️"
2. **Redirected** to intended page or home
3. **No shop selector** in navbar
4. **Standard customer experience**
